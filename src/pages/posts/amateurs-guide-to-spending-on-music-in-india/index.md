Being a musician in this country can sometimes feel like being a vegetarian in a steakhouse.

Anyone who's ever tried to, knows that you'll find it extremely hard to procure quality instruments and equipment without breaking the bank or getting ripped off.

##### If you don't care why, you may skip this section and go straight to [buying tips](#general-rules).

Growing up, it was emphasized to me that choosing music as a career meant throwing away all the academic opportunities that were handed to me, and even if I made that choice, anything outside the Indian classical genre was a form of degeneracy.

Sadly this sentiment exists throughout the country in some measure and as a result genres like rock or metal become a niche. The demand isn't high enough, so the supply isn't high enough, and the simple fact that you chose a drum kit over a [tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla), or a piano over a [harmonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_organ#Harmoniums) is reason enough for any store seller to overcharge you. Combine the fact that most reputable brands are not Indian, and now you have to deal with ridiculous import tax to top it off.

The deeper you dive into your hobby and the more specific your requirements get, the bigger the hole you will end up burning in your wallet. Unfortunately that's true for music here as well, except the niche is already dug deep for you. As a result no matter what, you will have to pay some premium, or exercise unreasonable patience if you don't want to rely on hard luck; but there are some general rules that will go a long way in trying to get a fair price, and depending on the instrument, things may be easier or harder.
