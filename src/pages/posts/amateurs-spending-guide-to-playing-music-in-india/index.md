Being a musician in this country can sometimes feel like being a vegetarian in a steak house.

Anyone who's ever tried, knows that you'll find it extremely hard to procure quality instruments and equipment without breaking the bank or getting ripped off.

##### If you don't care much about why that is the case, you may skip this section and go straight to [general buying rules](#general-rules).

Growing up, it was emphasized to me that choosing music as a career meant that I was discarding away academic opportunities that were handed to me, and even if I made that choice, anything outside the Indian classical genre was a form of degeneracy.

Sadly this sentiment exists throughout the country in some measure and as a result genres like rock or metal become a niche. Although new generations have done really well to change that, the number of people who listen to this genre isn't the statistic we want to measure; it's the number of people in this country who are _making_ music in this genre, which is a small fraction of the former.

The demand isn't high enough, so the supply isn't high enough, and the simple fact that you chose a drum kit over a [tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla), or a piano over a [harmonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_organ#Harmoniums) is reason enough for any middle-aged store seller to overcharge you. Combine the fact that most reputable brands are not Indian, and now you have to deal with ridiculous import tax to top it off.

The deeper you dive into your hobby and the more specific your requirements get, the bigger the hole you will end up burning in your wallet. Unfortunately that's true for music here as well, except the niche is already dug deep for you. As a result no matter what, you will have to pay some premium, or exercise unreasonable patience if you don't want to rely on hard luck; but there are some general rules that will go a long way in trying to get a fair price, and depending on the instrument, things may get easier or harder.

<h3 id="general-rules" class="internal-link">General rules</h3>

*   Buying second hand is almost always the way to go

    *   This is a valuable life skill in general. Buying used will give you really good deals. Learn to negotiate well and test what you're buying thoroughly before making your purchase.
    *   Personally I've found [OLX](https://www.olx.in/musical-instruments/) to be a good source for listings. A lot of my success stories on some really amazing deals for the instruments I play today are from there.
    *   Posting on sites like reddit or facebook may also get you somewhere. I've found that my city has a very active facebook group for buying and exchanging instruments and equipment, but your mileage may vary.
    *   The second hand market in India for music isn't as fast moving however, so depending on how specific and rare the thing you're looking for is, you may have to wait weeks or months till you find a good deal.

*   If you can't wait for good second hand deals, going to a store and buying is better than buying online

    *   Instruments will sound very different when you hear them being played on a Youtube video vs in your room. Buying from a store lets you hear what it sounds like in person before buying, which you cannot do online.
    *   Most stores also do price matching, i.e if you can show them a reputable online marketplace selling the same item for a lower price, they will drop their price down to match it.

*   Do your research and watch out for the cheap 'entry level' stuff that you know is of low quality

    *   The prices might be very tempting, but playing on bad instruments will tend to demotivate or limit you from playing further, and you will end up spending more anyway when you have to upgrade.
    *   If your justification is that you just want to give it a trial or you're on a super low budget, either borrow from a friend, or sign up for classes and use what's available in the institute.

<h3 id="general-rules" class="internal-link">Guitars</h3>

All things considered, buying any kind of guitar is relatively easy compared to other instruments. The reasoning behind it is also simple if you followed my opening paragraphs: there's a lot of people who play it. \
If you throw a brick outside through your window, chances are it will hit a guitar player.

Even so, although buying the actual guitar will probably not pose a problem, it's buying equipment like amplifiers, interfaces or pedals that will get you.

**Acoustic Guitars** are pretty straightforward and generally inexpensive. Just stick to a reputable brand and you should be good. If you're just starting out, it's understandable if you buy from a store or online.

**Electric Guitars** are a little more complicated and easier to overspend on. Make sure the pickups and bridge style hold up to a minimum quality and it has all the features you want. While some things can be swapped out later, you may find it tremendously hard to add a whammy bar or a kill switch to your guitar if it doesn't have one. If you're buying used, keep in mind that you may have to change the strings at the very least.

**Bass Guitars** (mostly electric, but acoustic basses also exist), tend to be a bit more expensive. Pickup arrangement along with scale length are two factors you should consider depending on your playing style. Four string and five string basses are very common, and while I personally think more strings won't give you any extra superpowers, the five string will cost more than the four string.

**Pedals**: If you're an enthusiast who plays electric, this is probably where a lot of your money will go. If you're on a budget but you want effects, don't bother with pedals, just get an effects processor. Sure it's cheaper, and it's digital, but it will get the job done.

Analog pedals on the other hand, control just one effect each, and a single one can cost more than a processor that has all the effects. If you're a tone snob however, you will find that it's still totally worth it. Pedals are among the most bought and sold equipments in music luckily, so they're easy to acquire second hand.

If you're feeling adventurous, you can try buying lesser known brands from AliExpress to experiment with, but you may not want to use those while jamming or playing live. I am a fan of Boss pedals, but sadly I cannot recommend them to anyone on a budget unless you can find a particular good deal for a used one.

**Interfaces** and **Amplifiers** are more or less out of the scope of this post. Anything of quality is going to be considerably expensive at which point this will no longer be an amateur's guide. While I admit my experience with them is limited, I've found that on the budget side, you tend to get what you pay for. I use a Focusrite interface for recording that I bought new for ~8k INR and a second hand Marshall MG10 practice amplifier that sounds surprisingly good on the clean channel. While I have nothing to complain about, I've jammed on better amplifiers for long enough to know that I will not be taking my practice amplifier outside my room.

Note to beginners: If you plan to play an electric guitar live, it is important to have a tuner pedal, and a reasonably long good quality cable.

*   Stay away from :
    *   Knockoff Indian brands like 'Fendar', 'Givson' or 'Yemaha'. This is not a joke, these companies exist and they sell actual guitars.
    *   Second hand guitars that show signs of neglect or damage. Wood (and electronics) don't mix well with exposure to water or heat.
    *   Low quality 10 watt practice amps that come bundled with electric guitars as a set, and are manufactured by the same company.

<h3 id="general-rules" class="internal-link">Drums</h3>

Tell me if this is wrong: If you knew anyone who had a drum kit in their house growing up, they probably came from money.

Finding good drummers are so hard, that it's part of the reason why I became a drummer myself. It seems like if you have the drummer taken care of, you're almost done with putting together a band.

Anything drum related will be heavy on your wallet if it is of quality, but before you give up and order a Cajon to wipe your tears with, you might want to check again if things are really out of your budget.

**Electronic Drum Sets** might actually be a smart option despite the stigma. Even though they can be a bit expensive by themselves, think about it this way: \
You'll save money on buying expensive recording equipment for an acoustic kit (your electronic kit will give you midi output anyway), \
you'll save money on replacing things like drum heads and cracked cymbals; \
and most of all, you'll save money on soundproofing your room, which you will have to do with an acoustic kit if you live in an apartment and you don't want your neighbors or landlord to drop kick your ass to the tune of Eye Of The Tiger.

They're really good for recording or practicing, but not ideal for lugging them along to play live. Depending on your needs, you might be fine even if you don't buy the super expensive ones, but know that the feel of playing (and listening) won't be the same as the real thing.

**Acoustic Drum Kits** are no joke to buy and maintain. I would recommend against buying a complete kit with shells, hardware and cymbals as a set, because they usually skimp out on one or more of those units, and the ones that don't will cost you more than if you bought them separately (some manufacturers will give you shells plus hardware in the set without the cymbals, and those might be fine). I will split them further into different sections for readability.

**Shells** are not as hard to acquire, but they aren't always cheap either. If you buy good ones, you'll have the advantage of them coming with decent drum heads to start playing with. While a lot of drummers would say that you can make cheap shells sound amazing by just changing heads and tuning, there are some differences you should research about. Maple vs Poplar wood has an effect on tone for eg, and the entry level compared to more expensive shells from Pearl, Tama or Mapex will sound different.

**Drum heads**: Buy Evans, Remo, or Aquarian. Research to figure out whether you want coated, hydraulic, double ply, etc.

**Hardware**: You don't necessarily have to go for the expensive stuff, but don't cheap out either, else you'll get cymbal stands that are shaky and fall, or boom arms that won't take the weight of the cymbal. If you're confident enough, you could even try DIY for hardware. Low quality bass pedals will limit you from playing fast and strain your feet out faster, so I'd recommend prioritizing your hardware budget there first.

**Cymbals** are an absolute nightmare to buy as an Indian drummer (Apart from the shitty brass ones that I will pretend do not exist). They're ridiculously expensive to buy new, and given how few people are buying in the first place, you'd go for months at a time before finding a deal on a used one.

I've done the math and figured out that it would actually be cheaper to fly to a different country, buy the cymbals there and bring it back. Believe it or not, people I know who play drums but also have to go abroad often for reasons, end up doing just this.

That might not be a realistic solution for people like you or me however, so it might be a worthwhile investment to network with professional musicians just so you can be there when a drummer upgrades and wants to sell his older stuff. If you don't want to wait so long to find a used deal, look up the prices online (Bajaao and Amazon are good sources), and ask a nearby store if they would price match. It might be a good idea to discuss this over a call first because most stores don't keep cymbals in stock (except the brass ones, but we're still pretending those don't exist), and you wouldn't want to waste a trip.

*   Stay away from :
    *   Cheap or local manufacturers like Chancellor, Jinbao, Havana, etc.
    *   Any kind of brass cymbal. These are usually the cheapest, have a very yellow color compared to bronze cymbals, and every major brand has one targeted at 'beginners'. These include :
        *   Zildjian: Planet Z series
        *   Sabian: sbr series and solar series
        *   Meinl: HCS series
        *   Paiste: PST3 series and 101 series
        *   (_These are the ones you should **not** buy_)

If you're married or in a relationship, good luck trying to explain to your significant other why your hobby costs more than maintaining a drug habit.

Jokes aside, I hope this post helped you out. If you feel like I've missed something or there's better resources out there, do let me know.

I hope you find success as a musician in this country. No matter your music genre, know that the whole Indian family spiel:

> music career kyu? TCS mein nahi mila placement?

is something you're attempting to go against, which in itself is something to be proud of, even if you actually work in TCS by day and play some guitar as a hobby on the side.
