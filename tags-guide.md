### A brief documentation on how I assign tags to my posts

Every post has 4 tags.

-   The first tag must be one of `rant`, `guide`, or `narration`. This decides the writing style of the post and in what nature information is delivered to the reader. For this blog at the very least, I will not use any other style.

-   The second tag must be one of `technology`, `music`, `astronomy`, or `personal`. This decides the major theme of the post and in effect also decides the audience for that post. Unless I also become an expert on another major field (which is unlikely given how much effort it took for these), I will not attempt to write about anything else, especially on a topic that I don't know anything about.

-   The third tag is an abstraction over the first two tags. It can indicate a major sub-theme such as `meta`, `finance`, `diy`, etc or it can indicate more about the writing style of the presented content such as `comparison`, or `psa`. If no such meaningful tag can be derived, select an extra tag from the next category.

-   The fourth tag is simply a keyword relating to the post itself. This is mainly for SEO. If a tag cannot be selected from the third category, I will select two from this one. The tag must be cleanly identifiable and should have a direct and meaningful relation to the blog post.

In conclusion, it should be possible for a reader to read the title of the post + the tags and get an intuitive idea of what most of the post will be about. It is then my job to keep the reader entertained as they explore their guess if they do decide to have a read.
