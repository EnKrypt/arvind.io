This blog has without doubt been a big part of my life. I wrote my first blog post on March 2012. \
Since then, this blog has recorded several events of my life, gone through many transformations and been read by many tens of thousands of viewers.

A lot of the original posts are not here anymore. They've been archived and kept aside for this version; but if you had followed my blog through those years, you would watch me grow from a child to an adult. As my sense of self matured, so did my ability to write better.

This blog has been hosted on oh so many domains in that time. If you were a part of that journey, some of these might ring a bell.

- `enkrypt.blogspot.in`
- `enkrypt.duckdns.org`
- `blog.enkrypt.in`

My most valued asset in this blog is you, the viewer. Whether or not you landed here from another post, from a search engine, or because someone gave you my visiting card, this post that you're reading right now is not an actual blog post. It's here simply as extra information to anyone who made it all the way here to the end and wants to know a bit more about the meaning and the little history behind this place.

If you came here for an old blog post that once existed, I can give you a copy of course. Believe it or not, I used to blog about all kinds of crap, including social issues and weird abstract concepts among coding jargon. If you're looking for the unbeatable tic tac toe algorithm that I once wrote (I still get hits from Google on that endpoint even though it's been removed from Google's index long ago), I have to tell you that there are better and more efficient algorithms that have emerged since.

As is tradition in every iteration of my blog, this one has some easter eggs too. If you're a developer, the javascript console might have some clues, and if you're a long time subscriber of this blog, the old method works as well.

Thank you for being a part of this nostalgia trip, and I hope I will have enough content in the future that it won't be as easy to reach all the way down to this post. The past version of me who created this blog for the first time would be glad to know this blog still exists and that you were there to read it.
