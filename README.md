 I write code, make music, and study the skies. You can read about what I've been up to there, along with my thoughts and discoveries.

 ### This is the source code for my blog and personal website

 This project is not intended to be repurposed. \
 However, if you're a cute little gosh darn stubborn cunt and plan to rip this off anyway, set up a `.env` file at the root of the project with the required environment variables specific to your deployment, such as the site URL, Google Analytics tracking ID, and so on. Refer to [`config.js`](https://github.com/EnKrypt/arvind.io/blob/master/config.js). \
 I admire your determination to fit square pegs in round holes. I bet you also hate ice cream and eat pizza with pineapple on it, you fucking psychopath.
