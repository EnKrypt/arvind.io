 I write code, make music, and study the skies. You can read about what I've been up to there, along with my thoughts and discoveries.

 ### This is the source code for my blog and personal website

 This project is not intended to be repurposed. \
 However, if you're stubborn enough and plan to rip this off anyway, make sure you go through the config files and remove values specific to my deployment, such as the site URL, Google Analytics tracking ID, and so on.

 #### Built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
